Movie Recommendation System | Python,Vectorization, Content-Based Filtering, NLP (Link)
• Developed a content-based movie recommender system using Python, recommending movies based on similarities in
genre, cast, director, and movie summary.
• Performed data preprocessing by removing irrelevant columns, cleaning the data, and merging all input features into
a single column containing a paragraph of keywords for each movie to improve similarity calculations.
• Utilized vectorization techniques to compute similarity scores and provide movie suggestions.
• Implemented the system using libraries like scikit-learn for vectorization and similarity calculations
